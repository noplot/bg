# SEASON2

*this is for me. it's to have fun ;)*

## Idea Vomit
- **agent0**
    1. crawls the internet and follows popular athletes (the main account would never)
    2. athlete information is collected and grouped into a marketplace
    3. deals are sent directly to the athlete in their social media inbox
- **lib**
    1. classic link in bio nonsense
    2. give them an easy marketplace to sell from and add merch to
- **inserts**
    1. inserts that go into some part of social media content
    2. smart-contracted so payments deliver automatically
- **support**
    1. provide resources for ad creation, transactions, and creativity
- **coalitions** 
    1. groups of athletes that can partner together to attract brands
    2. allows athletes to partner with merch and instagram-biz companies
- **velveeta**
    1. provide tooling for handling brand/advertisement deals intuitively

## General Unknowns
- should we entice the athlete or the freelance agent?
    - athletes. duh.

## Resolution
agent0 seems a little genius. 

## DOES STEVE JOBS DO MARKDOWN BRAINSTORMS?
- starting this section so i can write anytime i interrogate if a markdown brainstorm is a 
good idea. how annoyingly obsessive this thought is. shouldn't i just know the answer? 
poof! i understand exactly how to build 'self-agency'. you're a twat. how can you know if you
don't think? or, are you afraid of deciding there is no inspiration here. pussy. 
- if we were presented with the current state-of-the-art we could definitely do this instantly. 
which is why a brainstorm is a honest mechanism of generating questions. there is no problem to 
solve without a question - literally. then you can practice all the creative innovation you want. 
- this document is also a mechanism of not discarding ideas. sure - a brainstorm will give me great
questions to ask, but it will also help delineate ideas and features. its obviously valuable to have
a library of old ideas to fallback on or to reference. let the words map the topology of the idea.
- no one believes when i said i thought about it - show them. 

## Platitudes
- 'self-agency' is an incredibly large open problem (unlike the future of interfaces)
- questions are a certificate of labor!
- writing the idea down can only snapshot details. it won't destroy it. 
- a 'thought doc' is totally a thing. im gonna make it a thing.
