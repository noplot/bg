# Live Site Launch
we want to create a live site - frontend and backend hosted.

## Technologies
- Digital Ocean
- Docker
    - yes; this allows us to 'always run' and have multiple instances
- [ Cloud Postgres Service ]
    - hmm; not sure which one to use here
- CentOS

- what is the best sql service to use?
- is centos still the best option here?

## Execution
- [ ] put nextjs in a docker container (if possible)
- [ ] deploy docker nextjs to digital ocean
- [ ] test ent compatibility with local postgres
- [ ] put backend in a docker container
- [ ] deploy docker backend to digital ocean
- [ ] setup load balancer on digital ocean
- [ ] setup cloud mysql instance
- [ ] have smelly scrape ~20 tiktok users into a csv
- [ ] parse csv data into ent framework
- [ ] make `/season2` landing that lists tiktok handles
- [ ] build graphql into backend to query tiktok users into `/season2`
- [ ] buy the noplot.io domain on google (~$60)
